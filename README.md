# Features

## Operation in order of entry
- Unlike scientific calculator, This executes numbers and operators in order of your input.
  - If you input `6 + 3 * 2`, it results `36`, not `12`.
- This is because it copied almost all of features of calculator application in Windows 10.

## Basic floating-point error mitigation
- Try `0.1 + 0.2`. It results `0.3`.
- Not supported when calculating square root.

## Nice and cool dark mode
- Turn on and off dark mode by toggling the button in side menu, and it's cool. üòé
